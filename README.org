* Store EIEIO objects using EmacSQL

Store uniform [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eieio/index.html][EIEIO]] objects in an [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacsql][EmacSQL]] database.  [[https://www.sqlite.org][SQLite]] is used
as backend.  This library imposes some restrictions on what kind of
objects can be stored; it isn't intended to store arbitrary objects.
All objects have to share a common superclass and subclasses cannot
add any additional instance slots.
