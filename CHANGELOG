* v0.4.0    UNRELEASED

- Class tags are now automatically abbreviated when being stored in
  the database because that gives friendlier results when querying it
  direct.

  It was already possible to do that before by implementing the
  generic functions ~closql--class-to-sql~ and ~closql--sql-to-class~.
  These functions were replaced by the functions ~closql--abbrev-class~
  and ~closql--expand-abbrev~, which have different signatures and allow
  subclasses to strip a common prefix and/or suffix by setting the
  object slots ~closql-class-prefix~ and ~closql-class-suffix~ instead of
  having to define methods for these subclasses.

- The function ~closql--where-class-in~ isn't merely intended for
  internal use anymore and was renamed to ~closql-where-in-class~.

- Added new internal function ~closql--list-subbrevs~.

- The internal function ~closql--oref-default~ was removed.

- The function signature of ~closql--remake-instance~ changed.
